# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy is issued by Rodrigo Jose Llopis Ivas ("the Developer").

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy applies to the use of the social-media-content-creator ("the App"), a locally-deployed software application available through the public GitHub repository. This document explains how data is handled when you use the App. By downloading, using, or forking the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy.

## 2. No Data Collection
The App is designed to operate locally on your personal computer. **The Developer does not collect, store, or process any personal data** through your use of the App. This includes data such as names, email addresses, IP addresses, or any other personally identifiable information.

## 3. Third-Party Platform Interactions
If you use the App to generate content for third-party platforms (such as TikTok), you should be aware that those platforms may collect data based on your use of their services. **The Developer is not responsible for any data collected or processed by third-party platforms**. You should review the privacy policies of the platforms you interact with for more information on how they handle your data.

### TikTok API Usage
If the App integrates with TikTok’s API, any interaction between the App and TikTok will be subject to TikTok’s own privacy policy and terms of service. You are responsible for complying with TikTok's privacy and data handling practices.

## 4. Forking and Modifications
If you fork or modify the App, the Developer is not responsible for any data collection or processing that may occur as a result of those modifications. Any data collection or usage added to the App by third parties or through forked versions is outside the control of the Developer and not covered by this Privacy Policy.

## 5. Local Data Storage
The App may store certain files (such as generated video files or configuration files) on your local computer as part of its normal operation. **The Developer does not have access to this data**, as it resides solely on your local device.

## 6. Changes to the Privacy Policy
The Developer reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If any changes are made, the updated policy will be posted in the GitHub repository. Continued use of the App after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of those changes.
